        <p>
            Hello,
            I'm Eli and I am studying for a bachelors degree in Computer Science. I am 36 years old, have two cats, and
            I love gardening. I am learning many awesome concepts that I will show you here. The two main subjects I
            have studied so far are Web Design, and C#
            programming. Web Design has taught me how to write HTML and CSS code. I have also learned how to utilize
            bootstrap and different web services, like Figma for wireframing and Google Fonts for text and icon options.
        </p>
        <h1>
            C#
        </h1>
        <p>
            I have been learning C#. I have written many console apps. I have understanding of different data types. Classes and Objects with my custom data types. I know how to build constructors, and call methods from other classes. I understand conditional statements and loops. I am also learning how to collaborate effectively with others.
        </p>
        <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>
        <P>
            I have learned how to build websites using HTML and CSS. I know how to link a style sheet, and use outside tools like Google Fonts and Bootstrap. I have a good understanding of flexbox and grids so I can layout the page the way I want. I know how and when to use different tags. I have also learned how to embed styles in the HTML page. I can link images, sound, and videos/gifs to a page if needed. I feel like I have an artistic view and am good at matching colors and recognizing a nice flow to a page. I have passed the Certiport Exam for HTML and CSS as of May 11, 2023. I plan to continue my education in web design.
        </P>

            HairStylist
        </h3>
        <p>
            I have been a hairstylist for the past ten years. I am excellent at hairstyles and color. I can do an awesome perm, even on extra short or long hair. I am currently working at SmartStyle Hair Salon inside of Wal-Mart. I know that I am worth more than what this salon can offer, but I plan on leaving after I graduate from Ozarks Technical Community College. I currently have a job that I love, but my wrists are giving out and I need to change directions before I end up unable to work.
        </p>
        <h3>
            My Cats
        </h3>
        <p>
            I have two cats named Kemo and Garth. Kemo is thirteen years old, while Garth is about 7 years old. Kemo was
            the only kitten to be born, instead of being part of a litter. I have never heard of this happening before.
            My other cat Garth chose me, instead of me choosing to get another cat. At first he was hanging around
            pretending to be the other black cat that was living there at the time. I picked Garth up thinking that he
            was my room mate's cat. I walked up to him holding the new cat and said "I think your cat looks sick.
            Something is wrong with him." He replies "That is not my cat! Where did this guy come from?". The two cats
            have been friends ever since.
